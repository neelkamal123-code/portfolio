### Notes
The implementation follows Next.js App Router best practices:
1. Analytics component is imported from the correct package path
2. Component is placed at the root layout level for site-wide tracking
3. Component is positioned inside the body tag as recommended
4. No additional configuration needed - Vercel Analytics works automatically when deployed to Vercel

The project is ready for deployment with Vercel Web Analytics fully functional.
